## Introduction

This repository is a compilation of my self-learning journey in the field of data science and machine learning. It contains a wide range of topics, from basic statistical analysis to advanced machine learning models and techniques. 

**Goals**:
- Explore different machine learning algorithms
- Perform data analysis and visualization
- Implement projects and solve real-world problems
- Gain hands-on experience using Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and more

## Project Structure
I organized this project with numerical labels on the subfolders that correspond loosely to order of learning and order of application to a real-world project.
| Numerical Label | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 01 | Basic Python packages for data science such as NumPy and Pandas |
| 02 | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization |
| 03 | Statistics, Metrics, Math |
| 04 | Data Preprocessing, Data Preparation, Feature Engineering  |
| 05 | Machine Learning Techniques and Algorithms |
| 06 | Additional Topics such as SHAP |
| 09 | Real-World Application and Practice |

## Getting Started

To run the notebooks and explore the content, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Python 3.11 recommended):**

```bash
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
3. **Install the Required Packages:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
